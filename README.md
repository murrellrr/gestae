# Gestae
**An Imperative, Resource-Based, Event-Driven RESTful Framework**

## Why Gestae?

Most popular frameworks like Express.js, Next.js, and Nest.js use explicit URI declaration and often miss the point of REST by treating endpoints as mere function calls rather than as direct representations of resources. In a resource-first, event-driven approach, the URI itself embodies the relationships between entities. By aligning endpoints with the natural structure of your data, you cut down on boilerplate code by eliminating the middle layer that merely converts function calls into database queries, letting you focus on the real business logic and interactions between resources.

In Gestae, you explicitly define resources and tasks, and the URI is implicitly defined at runtime. This event-driven design reverses the traditional approach by letting the inherent relationships between entities dictate the routing structure dynamically, rather than relying on predetermined middleware functions. The framework listens for events and processes tasks as they occur, ensuring that the architecture remains flexible and naturally aligned with the underlying business logic. This means you spend less time managing endpoint declarations and more time refining how resources interact, ultimately creating a leaner, more expressive API that mirrors the true structure of your data.
